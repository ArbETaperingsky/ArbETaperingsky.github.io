# introduction to JTEM(MTDPS)

# 1. What is JTEM?
JTEM ( Just Technology Education [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/zh-hans/) ) is a platform based on Minecraft sandbox games. According to its original intention, it contains two meanings: Technology and Education.

# 2. Interpretation of two meanings.
Technology: refers to all common technologies involving [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/zh-hans/). From inside the game to outside the game, from pvp technology, to Redstone technology, to instruction technology, from rewriting in-game files, to using general technology ( strengthening in-game technology application ), to programming development.
Education: specifically refers to the educational nature of Minecraft, and [JTEM（MTDPS）](https://arbetaperingsky.github.io/JTEM.MTDPS) is not relevant for the time being.

# 3. what is MTDPS?
MTDPS( Minecraft Technology Destory Parts Shelter ) I give it a better name: Minecraft Technology Destory Parts Shelter. ( at least I think so ) MTDPS is dedicated to the technical knowledge of Minecraft. Its purpose is to improve players' technical knowledge of Minecraft, and at the same time, it affects Minecraft technology and programming technology to some extent.

# 4. Relationships.
